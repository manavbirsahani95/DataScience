    "We came aross studies showing how facebook's algorithms of personalization, and engagement on media platforms end up filtering out viewpoints that are different then their own. This led to the formation of echo-chambers, and made people think their view is the global one. For example, the anti-Republican people believed that Donald Trump would never win, and that had a susbstantial influence on voting. This was our first discovery of how media influences people's political beliefs.\n",

This made us consider that it might be the other way around! Since studies have shown what a tremendous impact media platforms like facebook can have on the political climate, then perhaps television is not a reflection of the political environment, but ACTUALLY SHAPES THE FUTURE! In other words, it causes the real world to reflect the cultural, social, and political state of society displayed in the show.\n",

This drove our question: is there a correlation between the sentiments that television shows display about certain politicians and the way people vote?\n",

    "There are potential biases in the data since dialogues of TV shows are written by screenwriters of those TV shows; the dialogues might reflect the political leaning of the writers and the tone of the shows. However, a point can be made that shows like South Park tend to poke fun at both sides of the political spectrum, therefore giving plenty of data (both positive and negative) on each candidate for us to work with. Since our topic concerns politics, there will always be biases, but political biases are in fact what we are trying to study here, as we want to examine the political impact of satire TV shows and how they bias people's feelings about certain political figure or ideology. Therefore, biases in dialogues are not big issues here. Other data we use in this research are poll numbers. Different institutions do polls and often get different numbers throughout the years. Poll numbers might not be an accurate representation of popularity. For example, in the 2016 election, Donald Trump won over Hillary Clinton despite poll numbers favoring Clinton. One thing we can do is to take the average of different polls to best reflect actual feelings of voters."

Additionally, there may be indication that political cartoons may in fact influence the opinions of viewer and would therefore (if the audience size and the discussions generated is large enough) influenece election results.* This means that just like advertisements potray brands, there can be a separate form of subconsicous marketing used in these television shows, judging from the high impact they have. \n",
