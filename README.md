Research question :

Do American television shows (e.g. South Park, Futurama, etc) have an impact on the political climate in america? 

Hypothesis :
We hypothesize that there will be a positive correlation between the displayed political sentiments in television shows, and the political climate in America (i.e. positive political sentiments in the show towards a candidate improve public perception(measured by the change in poll results before and after the episode) of that candidate and vice versa.)
